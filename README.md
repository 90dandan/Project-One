## User Experience

### The year is 1978, your at the famous Studio 54 in New York awaiting the unvailing of a game unheard of. To much fanfair, people hold in their hands the brand new Simon Says. Get to experience the game with a bunch more button pressing only here. "Yay! I love pressing buttons for every function", "Gotta love those buttons!", "Who needs asynchronous functions anyway!" are only some of the things that can be heard over the cheer of the crowd as they click away!   

# Future Updates

- Sync functions to work independently without having to push buttons to continue.
- Implement noises
- Create different difficulties
